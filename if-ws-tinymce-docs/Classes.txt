`Web#` extension for `TinyMCE` provides following bindings:

* `tinyMCE` - namespace which contains many useful funtions 
* `tinymce.Editor` - editor class
* `tinymce.UndoManager` - class providing support for undo/redo operations
* `tinymce.dom.Selection` - class representing current selection 
* `TinyMCEConfiguration` - class not defined in `TinyMCE`, represens configuration options


= namespace `tinyMCE`

Following functions of `tinyMCE` namespace are important:
* `init(config:TinyMCEConfiguration)` - creates new `TinyMCE` editors based on configuration options `config`.
* `get(id:strign)` - returns instance of `TinyMCE` with given `id`.


Following example creates new `TinyMCE` instance, then using callback `oninit`( 
which executes after editor is initialized) we get instance of `TinyMCE` and 
alert its content.
