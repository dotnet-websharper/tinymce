% Overview

This WebSharper™ Extension provides a set of classes almost identical
to the ones documented in the [TinyMCE Documentation][TinyMCE-documentation]. When used in
WebSharper™ projects, these stub classes delegate the work to the
actual classes implemented in TinyMCE.

The extension was tested with TinyMCE 3.4.3.2. It provides formlet control for TinyMCE editor and 
bindings for most TinyMCE API.

After adding the reference to the project all the classes can be found
under the `IntelliFactory.WebSharper.TinyMce` module.
It is necessary to copy TinyMCE folder `tiny_mce` to `jscripts` folder inside web project.
